``github2`` - GitHub API v2 library for Python
==============================================

.. warning::

   GitHub are planning to `switch off API v2`_ on 2012-05-01, you should
   be looking to replace ``github2`` as soon as possible.

   Both remoteobjects_ and micromodels_ provide easy-to-use functionality for
   creating bindings to remote APIs, and should significantly reduce the amount
   of work needed in moving away from GitHub's API v2.

You should read the developer documentation for the `GitHub API`_ first.

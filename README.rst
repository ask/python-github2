.. warning::

   GitHub have marked API v2 as deprecated, you should be looking to replace
   your usage of ``github2`` in the near future.

   Both remoteobjects_ and micromodels_ provide easy-to-use functionality for
   creating bindings to remote APIs, and should significantly reduce the amount
   of work needed in moving away from GitHub's API v2.

This is a Python library implementing all of the features available in version 2
of the `GitHub API`_.

See the ``doc/`` directory for installation instructions and usage information.
If you prefer you can also read the `documentation online`_.
